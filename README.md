[buildah](https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah) nested inside of podman
itself.

## Usage

Each directory type contains scripts and/or Dockerfiles for creating different
types of containers suitable for different scenarios:

```
./
├── minimal/
│   ├── Dockerfile.el7
│   ├── Dockerfile.el8
│   ├── Dockerfile.f33
│   ├── el.inside.podman.sh
│   └── el.minimal.sh
├── workstation/
│   ├── Dockerfile.el7ws
│   ├── Dockerfile.el8ws
│   └── wsprep.sh
└── zones/
    ├── create_zone.sh
    └── destroy_zone.sh
```


### Zones

Zones are container runtimes with persistent storage that act more like
"regular systems" than traditional containers.

To run a zone, `cd` into `zones/` and run `create_zone.sh`.

### Workstation Containers

To build a 'workstation' zone, `cd` into `workstation/` and use `buildah` to
build the selected dockerfile.

**Example:** 

    buildah bud -t el8ws -f Dockerfile.el8ws .

You can instantiate the workstation images you build as zones from the `zones/`
directory.

**Example:** 

1. Build the `el8ws` workstation image from the Dockerfile as in the previous example
2. Change back into the `../zones/` directory
3. Run `./create_zone.sh`
4. Enter `el8ws` when prompted for the target.

### Minimal Containers

To build the minimal containers, `cd` into `minimal/` and run
`./el.inside.podman.sh`.

Output will be placed into an `images/` directory, and containers matching the
dockerfile extension name with `_buildah` and `_minimal` will be added to your
local image list.

## Reference

### Additional setup requirements for EL7.7+

The following steps were tested on CentOS 7.9 and adapted from [[0]] and [[1]]:

* Enable the `extras` repository
* Make sure you have `podman` and `buildah` installed:

  ```sh
  yum install -y podman buildah
  ```

* Make sure the `user.max_user_namespaces` sysctl is greater than zero:

  ```sh
  echo user.max_user_namespaces=10000 > /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf
  sysctl --system
  ```

* If you created your user account prior to EL7.7, configure `/etc/subuid` and
  `/etc/subgid` mappings for your existing user (In EL7.7+, `useradd` will
  automatically set these up when creating new accounts):

  ```sh
  echo "$(cat /proc/self/loginuid):200000:65536" >> /etc/subuid
  echo "$(cat /proc/self/loginuid):200000:65536" >> /etc/subgid
  ```

* Test a podman command:

  ```sh
  podman unshare cat /proc/self/uid_map
  ```

  * If you get an error like `Error: could not get runtime: cannot write
    setgroups file: open /proc/8449/setgroups: permission denied` and `findmnt
    /proc` shows a `hidepid=` greater than `0`, see
    https://access.redhat.com/discussions/5468621 and use [`podman` >=
    v1.8.2](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/5550)
